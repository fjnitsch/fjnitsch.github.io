I am an [Assistant Professor](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/moore/directory/nitsch_felix.php) of Marketing at the University of South Carolina, Darla Moore School of Business. I did a Post Doc at INSEAD and hold a Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology from the University of Düsseldorf, Germany.

I study how people behave on social media—why they post, what influences their choices, and how these platforms affect them psychologically. I’m especially interested in how platform design and reward systems shape user behavior. To explore these questions, I use a mix of methods, including analyzing large datasets, building analytical models, and running behavioral experiments. My work helps us better understand online consumer behavior, self-expression, and how user and company interests align on social platforms.

My background spans behavioral economics, computational psychology, and decision neuroscience. This broad training lets me apply a wide range of research methods and choose the best approach for each question I study.

I also ad honorem lead [EDUCAT](https://www.educatgermany.com), an international non-profit association that funds and promotes educational projects in the Global South. For example, we helped the expansion of a learning center in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
